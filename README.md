# Modeling_Cyber_Threat_With_LLM

I developed this project in the fall of 2023.

Abstract â€” In the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats, effective mapping and understanding of these threats is crucial.
This research proposal aims to explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the mapping of cyber threats using mainly the MITRE Frameworks. The MITRE Frameworks, with its structured approach to identifying, classifying, and mitigating cyber threats, provides an ideal platform for this study. By harnessing the power of LLMs, the goal is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cyber threat mapping. The proposed research will delve into the capabilities of LLMs in understanding complex threat patterns, predicting potential vulnerabilities, and suggesting effective information about the threat identified. The anticipated outcome is a robust, intelligent tool that can keep pace with the dynamic nature of cyber threats, thereby fortifying our cyber defense mechanisms.
